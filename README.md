# Better

## Basic
condition:
```
if, while
```

loop:
```
for, while
```

## Object oriented
Tenet of object oriented is to code to interface rather than implementation.<br>
i.e. any object has *push* and *pop* can treat like stack.<br>
Duck typing is really important to make clean object-oriented design.<br>
